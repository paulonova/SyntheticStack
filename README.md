#Tasks and Back Stack

A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job. 
The activities are arranged in a stack—the back stack)—in the order in which each activity is opened. 
For example, an email app might have one activity to show a list of new messages. When the user selects a message, 
a new activity opens to view that message. This new activity is added to the back stack. If the user presses the Back button,
that new activity is finished and popped off the stack. The following video provides a good overview of how the back stack works.
